Read four different types of books, such as poetry, fiction, nonfiction, or biographies. Do any ONE of the following for each book you have read:

1. Write a review of the book. Include what you liked/didn't like about the book. Include if you would recommend this book, and if so, who might enjoy reading it.
1. Watch a movie based on the book. What was the same between the book and movie? What was different? Which did you enjoy more? Discuss this with your merit badge neighbor.
1. Give a "book talk" to your class, troop, or patrol.
