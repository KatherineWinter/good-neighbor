Do ONE of the following:

1. For one day, keep a log in which you describe your communication activities. Keep track of the time and different ways you spend communicating, such as talking person-to-person, listening to teachers, listening to the radio or podcasts, watching television, using social media, reading books and other print media, and using any electronic communication device. Discuss with your neighbor what your log reveals about the importance of communication in your life. Think of ways to improve your communication skills.
1. For three days, keep a journal of your listening experiences. Identify one example of each of the following, and discuss with your neighbor when you have listened to:

- Obtain information
- Be persuaded
- Appreciate or enjoy something
- Understand someone's feelings

1. In a small-group setting, meet with other neighbors or with friends. Have them share personal stories about significant events in their lives that affected them in some way. Take note of how each neighbor participates in the group discussion and how effectively each neighbor communicates their story. Report what you have learned to your neighbor about the differences you observed in effective communication.
1. List as many ways as you can think of to communicate with others (face-to-face, by telephone, letter, email, text messages, social media, and so on). For each type of communication, discuss with your neighbor an instance when that method might not be appropriate or effective.
