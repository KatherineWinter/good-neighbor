Do TWO of the following:

1. Take a flight in an aircraft. Record the date, place, type of aircraft, and duration of flight, and report on your impressions of the flight.
1. Under supervision, perform a preflight inspection of a light airplane.
1. Obtain and learn how to read an aeronautical chart. Measure a true course on the chart. Correct it for magnetic variation, compass deviation, and wind drift to determine a compass heading.
1. Using one of many flight simulator software packages available for computers, "fly" the course and heading you established in requirement 2c or another course you have plotted.
1. Explain the purposes and functions of the various instruments found in a typical single-engine aircraft: attitude indicator, heading indicator, altimeter, airspeed indicator, turn and bank indicator, vertical speed indicator, compass, navigation (GPS and VOR) and communication radios, tachometer, oil pressure gauge, and oil temperature gauge.
1. Create an original poster of an aircraft instrument panel. Include and identify the instruments and radios discussed in requirement 2e.
