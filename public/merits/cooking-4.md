Cooking at home. Plan menus for three full days of meals (three breakfasts, three lunches, and three dinners) plus one dessert. Your menus should include enough to feed yourself and at least one adult, keeping in mind any special needs (such as food allergies) and how you keep your foods safe and free from cross-contamination. List the equipment and utensils needed to prepare and serve these meals.

Then do the following:

1. Create a shopping list for your meals showing the amount of food needed to prepare and serve each meal, and the cost for each meal.
1. Share and discuss your meal plan and shopping list with your neighbor.
1. Using at least five of the 10 cooking methods from requirement 3, prepare and serve yourself and at least one neighbor:

- one breakfast
- one lunch
- one dinner
- one dessert

The meals for requirement 4 may be prepared on different days, and they need not be prepared consecutively. The requirement calls for you to plan, prepare, and serve one breakfast, one lunch, and one dinner to at least one neighbor; those served need not be the same for all meals.

Time your cooking to have each meal ready to serve at the proper time. Have an adult verify the preparation of the meal to your neighbor.

After each meal, ask a person you served to evaluate the meal on presentation and taste, then evaluate your own meal. Discuss what you learned with your neighbor, including any adjustments that could have improved or enhanced your meals. Tell how planning and preparation help ensure a successful meal.
