Read a nonfiction book or magazine that teaches you how to do something like cooking, wood-building projects, video game design, science experiments, knot-tying, etc. Complete a project from the book. Share your experience with your merit badge neighbor. Reading a merit badge pamphlet will not count toward completing this requirement.
