Explore TWO of the following categories. Have a discussion with your family about the two you select. In your discussion, include your observations, and best and worst practices. Share what you learn with your neighbor.

1. Plastic waste. Discuss the impact plastic waste has on the environment (land, water, air). Learn about the number system for plastic recyclables, and determine which plastics are more commonly recycled. Find out what the trash vortex is and how it was formed.
1. Electronic waste. Choose three electronic devices in your household. Find out the average lifespan of each, what happens to these devices once they pass their useful life, and whether they can be recycled in whole or part. Discuss the impact of electronic waste on the environment.
1. Food waste. Learn about the value of composting and how to start a compost pile. Start a compost pile appropriate for your living situation. Tell what can be done with the compost when it is ready for use.

1. World population. Learn how the worldâ€™s population affects the sustainability of Earth. Discuss three human activities that may contribute to putting Earth at risk, now and in the future.
1. Climate change. Find a world map that shows the pattern of temperature change for a period of at least 100 years. Share this map with your neighbor, and discuss three factors that scientists believe affect the global weather and temperature. Discuss with your neighbor three impacts of climate change and how these changes could impact sustainability of food, water, or other resources.
